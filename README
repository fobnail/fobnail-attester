 This project is aimed to provide an Attester implementation
 for Attestation process which also should include local (and remote)
 plaform provisioning.

 As for attestation itself the Fobnail/charra (https://github.com/fobnail/charra)
 project could be used as an example and the base of future extentions.
 It provides a simple (not full) interaction between Attester and Verifier
 over CHARRA protocol.

 But local (and remote) provisioning must be performed before the attestation
 starts.

 The project depends on libcoap library.
 Install libcoap:
 - git clone --depth=1 --recursive -b 'develop' 'https://github.com/obgm/libcoap.git'
 - cd libcoap/
 - ./autogen.sh
 - ./configure --disable-tests --disable-documentation --disable-manpages --disable-dtls --disable-shared \
               --enable-fast-install
 - make -j
 - make install

 Make sure that you do not have libcoap-1-0-dev installed, as the headers might conflict.

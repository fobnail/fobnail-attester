This project is aimed to provide an Attester implementation
for Attestation process which also should include local (and remote)
plaform provisioning.

As for attestation itself the Fobnail/charra (https://github.com/fobnail/charra)
project could be used as an example and the base of future extentions.
It provides a simple (not full) interaction between Attester and Verifier
over CHARRA protocol.

But local (and remote) provisioning must be performed before the attestation
starts.
